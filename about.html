    <h1>Alex Howe</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
       I'm originally from a city in England called Northampton, but I've spent the majority of my life moving around. My family has settled in Michigan, Sydney, Australia, Virginia and I finally ended up here, in NYC. I came here to pursue my dreams, which were mainly centered in the fine and performing arts worlds, until I realized that I wanted to find a career that would allow me to be stable and from there, to freely be able to create my art as I felt inspired to do so. Pursuit has helped me realign myself with my goals.

      <h3>Hardest Challenges So Far</h3>
      <p>
       I'd say that every step of the way has been a challenge so far. 
      </p>
      <p>I've had to really do some work on myself. It's like a complete change to the way that my brain works in some ways, and it's also a huge shift in lifestyle but it's all well worth the effort.</p>
